# Whisper.OS
Nothing here yet. Just trying to get everything lined up for after
my cataract surgeries. Once I can see again, I will really start
working on all of this. Just... Please be patient. I'm just an old
hillbilly auto-mechanic, coding was something I did in my spare
time and even then only in some flavor of BASIC. I do not have even
close to the skills I need to start this, but I cannot put it off
any longer. My adopted Mom's blindness, before she died and my
recent cataract blindness this last year, amongst other things has
proven to me the need for this. Whisper.AI will be the core of the
Whisper.OS
Anyone who really wants to get involved, I won't lie... I'll need
all the help I can get to pull this off. An open-source, no-commercial
AI based, voice interactive Operating System is a huge undertaking.
But it's time to be free of the Microsoft hegemony and the confusion
that Linux offers 52 year old mechanics born and raised in DOS. Whisper
is MY dream, but it's for all of us. We deserve this. To finally have
an Operating system that is OURS. One that is intelligent enough to
help users who know nothing about programming, but also powerful and
flexible enough to still be useful for superusers and coders. If you
want more information, I will be setting up a contacts page on the
official Whisper.OS website. It cna be found at whisper-os.org or .com
or .net or .cloud. I will see what I can do about maybe Discord or
something eventually, there is already a Whisper.OS Fascistbook page,
but I doubt I will keep that any longer than I must. I have a Telegram
chatroom for Whisper as well, but as of yet, I may not always be around
until my eyes are fixed. These damned cataracts have had me out of work
for over a year now, so I've some serious catching up to do, but it gave
me the time I needed to finally decide to take my first step to bring
Whisper into the world.
Anyhue, best  wishes all,
